Mind-blowing! 🤯 Quantum teleportation achieved over the *existing* internet for the first time. Researchers led by Prem Kumar (Northwestern University) successfully sent quantum states through active fiber optic cables. This paves the way for quantum-connected networks 🌐, enhanced encryption 🔒, and powerful new sensing methods, all without new infrastructure. A monumental leap for the quantum internet! ✨ #QuantumComputing #TechBreakthrough #Innovation #FutureIsNow

🤯 Ever feel like social media is more toxic than real life? New research reveals a key reason: a tiny fraction of users creates the vast majority of extreme & misleading content. 🔍

For instance:
➡️ Just 10% of users produce ~97% of political tweets.
➡️ Only 0.1% share 80% of fake news.

This distorts our perception, making society seem more polarized than it is. Most people aren't fueling the outrage! 💡 Be mindful of whose voices dominate your feed.

Why does social media often feel so toxic, yet real life feels calm? 🤔 New research reveals it's largely due to a small, hyperactive group skewing our online reality.

Just 10% of users produce ~97% of political tweets, and a mere 0.1% share 80% of fake news. 🤯 This handful creates a "funhouse mirror" effect, making society seem far more polarized than it is.

A powerful reminder: what we see online isn't always representative. Be a conscious consumer of digital content! 💡 #SocialMedia #DigitalWellness #Misinformation #OnlineBehavior
